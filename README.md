# juegoOca
The funny board game "El juego de la oca", with a theme of the magical towns of Mexico.
This is a university project, i have already finished it, but since it needs a database and i dont really know how to upload a DB to github or the correct way to upload it, i will wait until i find a correct way to upload it.
